The Immutant to start is specified by the ~/.lein/immutant/current

precedence. You can shutdown the Immutant with ^C.

This task delegates to $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.[sh|bat], and
takes any arguments the standalone script accepts. To see a full
list, run `lein immutant run --help`.

It also takes the additional convenience arguments:

 --clustered  Starts the Immutant in clustered mode. This is
              equivalent to passing '--server-config=standalone-ha.xml`

By default, the plugin will locate the current Immutant by looking at
~/.lein/immutant/current. This can be overriden by setting the
$IMMUTANT_HOME environment variable."
