# lein-immutant [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/immutant/lein-immutant.png)](http://travis-ci.org/immutant/lein-immutant)

A Leiningen plugin for deploying Immutant apps.

## Usage

### Installation
    
As of version 0.15.0, the plugin only supports leiningen 2.0.0 and up.
To use it, add it to your `~/.lein/profiles.clj`:

    {:user {:plugins [[lein-immutant "1.0.0.beta2"]]}}
      
### Using it

The plugin provides several subtasks for installing, deploying to, and
running an Immutant. All of the subtasks are namespaced under the
`immutant` task. You can use `lein help immutant` to see a full list,
and use `lein help immutant SUBTASK` to get more detailed help for a 
specific subtask. 

The subtasks provided by the plugin are:

* `lein immutant install [version [install-dir]]` - downloads and
  installs Immutant for you. By default, it will download the *slim*
  distribution of the latest versioned release and put it in
  `<immutant base dir>/releases/`. You can override the version (which
  must be an incremental build number from
  http://immutant.org/builds/, a released version, or LATEST for
  the most recent incremental build) and the install
  directory. Wherever it gets installed, the most recently installed
  version will be linked from `<immutant base dir>/current`. If this link
  is present (and points to a valid Immutant install), you won't need
  to set `$IMMUTANT_HOME`. You can have it install the *full*
  distribution by passing it the `--full` flag.

* `lein immutant overlay [feature-set [version]]` - downloads and
  overlays a feature set onto the currenty installed Immutant. If it
  can't find an Immutant install (either via the `current` link or
  `$IMMUTANT_HOME`), it will download and install the latest
  versioned release first. Currently, the only supported feature set
  is 'torquebox'. The version defaults to the latest incremental, but
  can also be any recent build number from
  http://torquebox.org/2x/builds/.

* `lein immutant list [--installs]` - Lists deployments or Immutant
  installs. If called with no options, lists deployed applications. If
  given `--installs` (or `-i`), lists installed versions of immutant
  instead. When listing deploymens, it will only list disk-based ones,
  and won't list anything deployed via the JBoss CLI or management
  interface.

* `lein immutant env [key]` - prints out information about the
  Immutant environment. It currently only displays the path to the
  current Immutant, and the path to JBoss.
  
* `lein immutant new project-`name - calls `lein new project-name` for
   you, then calls `lein immutant init`.

* `lein immutant init` - creates a sample `immutant.init` namespace
  beneath `src/`
  
* `lein immutant archive [--include-dependencies] [--name name]
                         [--context-path path] [--virtual-host host] 
                         [path/to/project]` - 
  creates an Immutant archive (suffixed with `.ima`) in the current
  directory.  By default, the archive file will be named after the
  project name in project.clj.  This can be overridden via the
  `--name` (or `-n`) option.  This archive can be deployed in lieu of
  a descriptor pointing to the app directory. 

  Any profiles that are active (via with-profile) will be captured and
  applied when the app is deployed.

  If passed a bare argument, the task will assume it is a path to a
  project to be archived, and will switch to the context of that
  project. This works when lein is invoked in or out of a project.

  You can override the default context-path (based off of the
  deployment name) and virtual-host with the `--context-path` and
  `--virtual-host` options, respectively. If the
  `--include-dependencies` (or `-i`) option is provided, all of the
  application's dependencies will be included in the archive as
  well. 

  If the standard leiningen jar options `:omit-source` or
  `:jar-exclusions` are set, they will be honored for archive
  creation.

* `lein immutant deploy [--archive [--include-dependencies]] [--name name] 
                        [--context-path path] [--virtual-host host] 
                        [path/to/project]` - 
  deploys the current app to the current Immutant. If passed the
  `--archive` option, it will deploy an archive of the app instead of
  a descriptor pointing to the app on disk. This will currently
  recreate the archive on every deploy.  By default, the deployment
  will be named after the project name in project.clj.  This can be
  overridden via the `--name` (or `-n`) option.  

  If passed a bare argument, the task will assume it is a path to a
  project to be deployed, and will switch to the context of that
  project. This works when lein is invoked in or out of a project.

  Any profiles that are active (via with-profile) will be captured in
  the `:lein-profiles` key in the descriptor and applied when the app is
  deployed.

  You can override the default context-path (based off of the
  deployment name) and virtual-host with the `--context-path` and
  `--virtual-host` options, respectively.

* `lein immutant undeploy [name or glob or path/to/project]` - undeploys
  an application (or applications) from the current Immutant.  
  If passed a bare argument, the task will first treat it as a glob
  argument specifying one or more deployments to undeploy. If it does
  not match any current deployments, it is assumed to be a path to a
  project to be undeployed, and will switch to the context of that
  project. This works when lein is invoked in or out of a project.

  Examples of matching deployment names with globs:

  Given    Will undeploy
  -----    -------------
  ham      ham.clj, ham.ima
  ham.clj  ham.clj
  ha?      ham.clj, ham.ima, hat.clj, hat.ima
  *h*      ham.clj, ham.ima, ship.clj, ship.ima, moh.clj, moh.ima
  h*.clj   ham.clj, hat.clj
  *        everything

  Note that depending on your shell, you may have to quote or escape *
  and ? in globs.
  
* `lein immutant run` - launches the current Immutant. 

* `lein immutant test [path/to/project]` - Runs a project's tests
  inside the current Immutant. Runs the current Immutant, if
  necessary, deploys the project to it, runs all tests, undeploys the
  app, and then shuts down the Immutant it started. All tests
  specified in the `:test-paths` from project.clj will be executed.

  If passed a bare argument, the task will assume it is a path to a
  project to be tested, and will switch to the context of that
  project. This works when lein is invoked in or out of a project.

  This is a very simple way to automate your integration testing on a
  [CI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) host.
  
By default, the plugin places its files (installed Immutants, the
current link) under `~/.immutant/`. You can override this by setting
`$LEIN_IMMUTANT_BASE_DIR` or by adding `:lein-immutant {:base-dir
"/path"}` to your user profile in `.lein/profiles.clj` or to your
`project.clj`. Setting the base directory in `project.clj` will
override the setting in `.lein/profiles.clj`. Using the environment
variable will override both.

#### Using the plugin on Windows

There are two differences when using the plugin on windows:

* `<immutant base dir>/current` isn't a link to the currently active
  Immutant installation, but is instead a text file containing the
  path to that installation. This is to work around linking issues on
  Windows.

* Using `^C` to exit Immutant after calling `lein immutant run` will
  not work under [git-bash](http://msysgit.github.com/) or
  [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) - it instead just detaches the
  shell from the java process, leaving it running. Using `command.com`
  does not exhibit this problem.
  
## Development

The plugin has a mediocre midje test suite. You can run it via:

    lein midje
