  "Downloads and installs an Immutant version

By default, it will download the latest versioned release and put it
in ~/.immutant/releases/. You can override the version (which must be
an incremental build number from http://immutant.org/builds/, a
released version, or LATEST for the most recent incremental build)
and the install directory. Wherever it gets installed, the most
recently installed version will be linked to ~/.immutant/current. If
this link is present (and points to a valid Immutant install), you
won't need to set $IMMUTANT_HOME to notify plugin tasks of the
location of Immutant.

This task will install the 'slim' distribution unless given the
'--full' option.

By default, the install places its files (installed Immutants, the
current link) under ~/.immutant/. You can override this by setting
$LEIN_IMMUTANT_BASE_DIR or by adding :lein-immutant {:base-dir
\"/path\"} to your user profile in .lein/profiles.clj or to your
project.clj. Setting the base directory in project.clj will override
the setting in .lein/profiles.clj. Using the environment variable will
override both.

 On Windows, ~/.immutant/current is actually a text file
containing the path to the current Immutant instead of a link."
