# lein-immutant

A [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) plugin for deploying Immutant 2.x
applications to a [WildFly](http://wildfly.org/) application server.

## Usage

**Note:** as of Immutant 2.x, you /only/ need this plugin if you are
deploying your applications to a WildFly container. See [somewhere]
for more info.
