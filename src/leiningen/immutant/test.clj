  "Runs a project's tests inside the current Immutant

Runs the current Immutant, if necessary, deploys the project to it,
runs all tests found beneath the test/ directory, undeploys the app,
and then shuts down the Immutant it started. The --port option
specifies the nREPL service port through which the tests are invoked
inside the running Immutant.

By default, the plugin will locate the current Immutant by looking at
~/.lein/immutant/current. This can be overriden by setting the
$IMMUTANT_HOME environment variable."
