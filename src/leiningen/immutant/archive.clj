  "Creates an Immutant archive from a project

Creates an Immutant archive (suffixed with '.ima') in the current
directory. By default, the archive file will be named after the
project name in project.clj. This can be overridden via the --name (or
-n) option. This archive can be deployed in lieu of a descriptor
pointing to the app directory.

Any profiles that are active (via with-profile) will be captured and
applied when the app is deployed.

You can override the default context-path (based off of the deployment
name) and virtual-host with the --context-path and --virtual-host
options, respectively. 

If the --include-dependencies (or -i) option is provided, all of the
application's dependencies will be included in the archive as well.

If the standard leiningen jar options :omit-source or :jar-exclusions
are set, they will be honored for archive creation.

This task can be run outside of a project dir of the path to the
project is provided."
